what to do next:
------------------
Find out why sound reproduction is failed when reconstructed from audio vector in the case : recording using single channel ??
what is channel in recording ??


Analyze --> 
recording process : record object
audio vector generated 
various formats of audio-vector data . are they corresponds to sigle,double precision floating point and fixed point??
Playing process : play object

Try to understand  vector space analysis of audio-vector.  using octave and  linear algebra.

understand various filtering methods - and implement them on hardware.
